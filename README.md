Milkman
=======

Milkman is the fastest and cleanest way to manage your tasks on your Windows Phone. Milkman syncs with Remember The Milk, an online to-do list and task manager. You can easily view your tasks, create new reminders, and update your to-do lists right from your phone. Every change you make in Milkman is synced to your Remember The Milk account, so you'll never forget the milk (or anything else) again.

Milkman seamlessly integrates with your phone to display task counters on the application's live tile, it shows reminders before a task is due, and even allows you to set location-based reminders using Remember The Milk.

This application uses the Remember The Milk application programming interface but is not endorsed or certified by Remember The Milk.
